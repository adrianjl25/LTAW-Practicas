Thinking of you, wherever you are

We pray for our sorrows end,
and hope that our hearts will blend.
Now i will step forward to realize this wish.
And who knows,
Starting a new journey may not be so hard
or maybe it has already begun.
There are many worlds,
but they share the same sky
one sky, one destiny.
